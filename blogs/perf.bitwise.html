<h1>
  The Little Known Bitwise Operations and their Performance in JavaScript
</h1>
<p>
Bitwise operators treat their operands as a sequence of 32 bits (zeroes and ones), rather than as decimal, hexadecimal, or octal numbers.

  It seems to me developer don’t bother to learn about bitwise operators. They have been left alone!
</p>

<p>They are mostly not used because some feel that all developers don’t know them well and confuse them for their boolean equivalents. Like assume you are working on a big project and and you used something like (a & b), there is a very good probability that during code review someone would say that you missed an “&”, and it should have been “(a && b)”</p>

<p>These are the kind of reason why they are left alone. And they feel bad, they have feelings too you know!</p>

  So what if they treat any number as a sequence of 32 bits, their prejudice makes them very fast :P Seriously!!!
Number in JavaScript are stored in IEEE-754 64-bit format. For Bitwise operations these are converted to 32 bit signed representation.
Despite this conversion taking place, it is assumed that bitwise operations are very fast.
Before we get into bitwise operations, lets look at how to see a number in binary?
The Number.prototype.toString method takes radix(Optional)which is an integer between 2 and 36 specifying the base to use for representing numeric values.
We can use the toString(2) method. Notice that we are passing an argument 2, which basically means return string in binary.

</p>

<code>
  //See number in binary
var a = 2;
a.toString(2); //this returns string "111"
</code>

<p>basic description of the operations are as follows:</p>

<p>So I decided lets put it to a simple test myself. It is common to see a row altering style for tables, where we give separate style for odd/even.
The only difference in the below code is instead of “i % 2”, I have changed it to “i & 1”
</p>

<code>
  //row alternating example
//Normal way
function usualWay() {
  var evenUsual = 0;
  var oddUsual = 0;
  for (var i=0, len=10000000; i < len; i++) {
    if (i % 2) {
      //"odd"
      oddUsual++;
    } else {
      //"even";
      evenUsual++;
    }
  }
}
function bitWay() {
  var evenBit = 0;
  var oddBit = 0;
  for (var i=0, len=10000000; i < len; i++) {
    if (i & 1) {
      //"odd"
      oddBit++;
    } else {
      //"even"
      evenBit++;
    }
  }
}
usualWay();
bitWay();
</code>

<p>the outcome of this was bitwise was performing much faster for very larger inputs(iterations), but as the number of iterations came down the difference was very little and it does make you think, is it worth it?</p>

<p>
I would personally not use it unless I am running that operation thousands of times. Since some of the operations are not very intuitive to read and maintain.

<h3>Where else can I use these?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    <div>
      <h4>Bit fields (flags)</h4>
      They’re the most efficient way of representing something whose state is defined by several “yes or no” properties. ACLs are a good example; if you have let’s say 4 discrete permissions (read, write, execute, change policy), it’s better to store this in 1 byte rather than waste 4. These can be mapped to enumeration types in many languages for added convenience.

  </li>

    <div>
      <h4>Compression, Encryption</h4>
      Both of these are heavily dependent on bitwise algorithms. Look at the
      <a src="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEFLATE">deflate algorithm </a>for an example — everything is in bits, not bytes. Look at an implementation by nodeca in
      <a src="https://github.com/nodeca/pako/tree/master/dist">github.</a>

      <h4>Graphics</h4>
        There’s hardly enough space here to get into every area where these operators are used in graphics programming. Javascript functions for doing fast binary/hex/RGB color conversions using bitwise operations. https://gist.github.com/lrvick/2080648

      <h4>Save space</h4>
      Bit/Byte-Based Sorting Algorithm when space is at a premium. Using bits (or bytes) instead of types that take on more memory such as Strings, Objects, or what not, allows us to be able to search, sort, and store data more efficiently. Imagine a bit/byte-based data structure versus a traditional one with respect to sorting Integers, the byte array would allow us to implement Bucket Sort with little memory consumption.

      <code>
        Bucket sort works as follows:
        1. Set up an array of initially empty “buckets”.
        2. Scatter: Go over the original array, putting each object in its bucket.
        3. Sort each non-empty bucket.
        4. Gather: Visit the buckets in order and put all elements back into the original array.
      </code>

These are only few of the examples that I have added here, I have tried to provide link to the original source where possible. Please let me know your thoughts :)
