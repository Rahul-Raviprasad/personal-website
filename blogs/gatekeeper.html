## Efficiency of a Gate Keeper.

<p>
  I have been taking interviews for a long time and have experienced being on both sides of the table.
My manager once told me

“We are the Gate keeper to the candidates into our company, and by being selective about whom we allow and we don’t allow, we determine the quality of the entire company!”

I truly believe that. mostly because it is ok to miss out on good candidate, but you can never hire a bad person. False positives are very expensive to the company.

And I think this is the same philosophy that perhaps google follows, since they hire for the company and not the team. What that means is, probably there isn’t a hiring manager from one particular team. The interview panel would probably be from different teams and they all should like you and want to work with you.
The problem with this is we should also ensure we are not going tough on the candidate.
8 of the Google hiring team were given their own packets and they rejected all of them — Moishe Lettvin
so these people were going so tough on the candidates, compared to themselves when they got hired.
The opposite approach of hiring for a particular project and team(which I can understand but, I don’t like).
Pros:
you get what you want for the current project and the person can probably hit the ground running.
Cons:
If the requirement ends you have no reason to have that person around.
If the stack changes or the problem changes, you have hired the wrong person for the job.
And you can get into a bad loop of hiring people consistently who bring the average down.
